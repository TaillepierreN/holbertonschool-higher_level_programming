# Python - Everything is Object

This project delves into Python's object model, exploring the intricacies of objects, references, and mutability. It aims to deepen the understanding of how Python handles different types of objects and the implications of these mechanisms on Python programming.

## Background Context

This project emphasizes the concept that everything in Python is an object. It challenges preconceived notions about variable assignment, mutability, and object identity in Python through a series of questions and tasks. The project encourages a deeper understanding by discouraging the immediate use of the Python interpreter to answer questions, promoting critical thinking and research instead.

- [9.11. Aliasing](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#aliasing)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable)
- [Mutation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#odds-and-ends)

- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain:

- What an object is in Python
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What a reference is, and how assignment works in Python
- The concept of aliasing and its implications
- How to check if two variables are identical
- How to check if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (memory address in CPython)
- The distinction between mutable and immutable objects
- The built-in mutable and immutable types in Python
- How Python passes variables to functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Use Python 3.8.5, with all scripts starting with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Follow PEP 8 styling (version 2.7.*).
- Include a `README.md` at the root of the project directory.
- Ensure all files are executable.

### .txt Answer Files

- Provide answers in one line, with no shebang, and ending with a new line.

## Tasks

The tasks in this project involve answering questions about Pythonâ€™s object model, including object identity, mutability, and cloning lists. Answers should be provided in `.txt` files, with each task focusing on different aspects of Python's handling of objects.

### Highlights:

- **Who am I?**: Identifying functions for printing the type of an object.
- **Where are you?**: Understanding how to get the variable identifier.
- **List append vs. add**: Exploring the difference between appending to a list and adding lists.
- **Mutable vs. Immutable objects**: Distinguishing between mutable and immutable objects in Python.

## Additional Information

This project encourages a deep dive into Python's object model, promoting an understanding of how Python manages memory and handles variable assignment and modification. It's crucial for Python developers to grasp these concepts to write efficient, effective, and predictable code.
