# Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions

Welcome to the "Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions" project! This project, created by Guillaume and part of the Holberton School curriculum, is designed to introduce you to fundamental programming concepts in Python. You will explore conditional statements, loops, and functions, which are essential building blocks for any Python programmer.

## Level
Novice

## Weight
1

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you are expected to be able to explain, without assistance:
- The importance of indentation in Python.
- Usage of if and if...else statements.
- The purpose and use of comments.
- How to assign values to variables.
- Utilization of while and for loops.
- Implementation of break and continue statements.
- Use of else clauses on loops.
- Function and usage of the pass statement.
- How to use the range function.
- Fundamentals of functions and their usage.
- Behavior of a function that doesn't use a return statement.
- Scope of variables in Python.
- Understanding tracebacks.
- Arithmetic operators in Python.

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
  - Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*).
  - Files ending with a new line.
  - First line of all files: #!/usr/bin/python3.
  - A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project.
  - Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
  - All files must be executable.
  - File lengths tested using wc.

## Tasks
1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**: A program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether it is positive or negative.
2. **The last digit**: Script to print the last digit of a random signed number.
3. **The alphabet game**: Program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase using a loop and the `print` function.
4. **Alphabet soup**: Similar to the previous, but excludes certain letters.
5. **Hexadecimal printing**: Script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
6. **00...99**: Program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format.
7. **Combining brains and materials**: Prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
8. **Is lower**: Function checking for lowercase characters.
9. **To uppercase**: Function that prints a string in uppercase.
10. **The last digit function**: Function that prints the last digit of a number.
11. **a + b**: Function that adds two integers.
12. **a ^ b**: Function that computes a to the power of b.
13. **Fizz Buzz**: Function implementing the FizzBuzz problem.
