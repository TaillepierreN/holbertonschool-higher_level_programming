# Python - Classes and Objects

This project, part of the Holberton School curriculum, introduces the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Guided by Guillaume, students will explore the creation and implementation of classes and objects, understanding their application in real-world programming.

## Background Context

Understanding OOP is crucial for modern software development. This project emphasizes the importance of experimenting with OOP concepts, playing with classes and objects, and grasping the Pythonic approach to OOP.

## Learning Objectives

After this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The concept of "first-class everything" in Python
- Differences between a class and an object or instance
- The meaning and handling of attributes
- Use of public, protected, and private attributes
- The significance of the `self` keyword
- Definition and importance of methods and the special `__init__` method
- Concepts of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- The distinction between an attribute and a property in Python
- Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- Dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- The role of the `__dict__` in classes and instances
- Attribute finding mechanism in Python
- Usage of the `getattr` function

## Requirements

- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **Styling**: Code should follow PEP 8 style (version 2.7.*)
- **Execution**: All files must be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Documentation**: Each module, class, and method requires a docstring

## Tasks

0. **My First Square**: An empty class `Square` that defines a square.
1. **Square with Size**: A class `Square` that defines a square by its size.
2. **Size Validation**: Addition of size validation to the `Square` class.
3. **Area of a Square**: A method that computes the area of a square.
4. **Access and Update Private Attribute**: Getter and setter for the `size` attribute.
5. **Printing a Square**: A method that prints the square with the `#` character.
6. **Coordinates of a Square**: Introduction of the `position` attribute with getter and setter.
