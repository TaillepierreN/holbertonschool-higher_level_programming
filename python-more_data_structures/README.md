## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to explain, without assistance:
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- The usage and characteristics of sets and how to use them.
- Common methods of sets and their applications.
- The appropriate situations for using sets versus lists.
- Iterating over sets.
- The concept and usage of dictionaries in Python.
- When to choose dictionaries over lists or sets.
- The role of keys in a dictionary.
- How to iterate over a dictionary.
- The concept and applications of lambda functions.
- Understanding and using the map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
  - Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
  - Files ending with a new line.
  - First line of all files: #!/usr/bin/python3.
  - README.md file at the root of the project folder.
  - Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
  - All files must be executable.
  - File lengths tested using wc.

## Tasks
1. **Squared simple**: A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
2. **Search and replace**: A function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
3. **Unique addition**: A function that adds all unique integers in a list.
4. **Present in both**: A function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
5. **Only differents**: A function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
6. **Number of keys**: A function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
7. **Print sorted dictionary**: A function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
8. **Update dictionary**: A function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
9. **Simple delete by key**: A function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
10. **Multiply by 2**: A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
11. **Best score**: A function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
12. **Multiply by using map**: A function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using loops.
13. **Roman to Integer**: A function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

This project is designed to deepen your understanding of more complex data structures in Python and their practical applications.
