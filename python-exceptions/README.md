# Python - Exceptions

This project, led by Guillaume as part of the Holberton School curriculum, is designed to give students a practical understanding of handling exceptions in Python. The project covers different aspects of exceptions, including their usage, handling, and the distinction between errors and exceptions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- The difference between errors and exceptions.
- What exceptions are and how to use them.
- When it's necessary to use exceptions.
- How to correctly handle an exception.
- The purpose of catching exceptions.
- How to raise a builtin exception.
- Implementing a clean-up action after an exception.

## Resources
- [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling (starting at minute 7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vbgD-3s-w4)

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
  - Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
  - Files ending with a new line.
  - First line of all files: #!/usr/bin/python3.
  - README.md file at the root of the project folder.
  - Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
  - All files must be executable.
  - File lengths tested using wc.

## Tasks
1. **Safe list printing**: A function that prints x elements of a list using try/except.
2. **Safe printing of an integers list**: A function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
3. **Print and count integers**: A function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
4. **Integers division with debug**: A function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
5. **Divide a list**: A function that divides element by element 2 lists.
6. **Raise exception**: A function that raises a type exception.
7. **Raise a message**: A function that raises a name exception with a message.

Each task in this project is a step towards mastering the handling and implementation of exceptions in Python programming.
