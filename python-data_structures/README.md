# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project, part of the Holberton School curriculum and crafted by Guillaume, is an introduction to data structures in Python, specifically focusing on lists and tuples. It aims to build a strong foundation in understanding and manipulating these fundamental data types.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, students should be able to explain, without assistance:
- What lists are and how to use them.
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists.
- Common methods of lists and their usage.
- How to use lists as stacks and queues.
- List comprehensions and their applications.
- Tuples and their usage.
- When to use tuples versus lists.
- The concept of a sequence in Python.
- Tuple packing and sequence unpacking.
- The `del` statement and its usage.

## Resources
- [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
- [Data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)
- [Learn to Program 6: Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1HUzrvS-Pw)

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
  - Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
  - Files ending with a new line.
  - First line of all files: #!/usr/bin/python3.
  - README.md file at the root of the project folder.
  - Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
  - All files must be executable.
  - File lengths tested using wc.

## Tasks
1. **Print a list of integers**: A function that prints all integers of a list in a specific format.
2. **Secure access to an element in a list**: A function that retrieves an element from a list safely.
3. **Replace element**: A function that replaces an element in a list at a specified position.
4. **Print a list of integers... in reverse!**: A function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.
5. **Replace in a copy**: A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
6. **Can you C me now?**: A function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
7. **Lists of lists = Matrix**: A function that prints a matrix of integers.
8. **Tuples addition**: A function that adds 2 tuples.
9. **More returns!**: A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
10. **Find the max**: A function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
11. **Only by 2**: A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
12. **Delete at**: A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
13. **Switch**: Complete the source code to switch values of `a` and `b`.

Each task is designed to provide practical experience with Python lists and tuples, reinforcing the learning objectives of this project.
