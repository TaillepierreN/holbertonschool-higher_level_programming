# Python - Hello, World

## Introduction
Welcome to the Python world! This project is the first step in your Python programming journey, introducing you to the basics of this powerful, versatile language. Expect to learn different ways of achieving the same goal, as Python offers flexibility in its approach to problem-solving.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Use the Python interpreter.
- Print text and variables using `print`.
- Understand and use strings in Python.
- Know what indexing and slicing are.
- Understand the official Python coding style and check code with pycodestyle.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Environment**: Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*).
- **Style**: Code should follow PEP8 style guidelines.
- **Execution**: All files must be executable.
- **Documentation**: A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory.

## Tasks
1. **Hello, print**: Write a Python script that prints a specific string followed by a new line using the `print` function.
2. **Print integer**: A script that prints an integer stored in a variable, followed by a specific string.
3. **Print float**: Script to print a float to two decimal places.
4. **Print string**: Script to print a string three times and then its first 9 characters.
5. **Play with strings**: Combine two predefined strings and print the result.
6. **Copy - Cut - Paste**: Manipulate a string and extract specific parts of it.
7. **Create a new sentence**: Use string slicing to create a new sentence from parts of an existing one.
8. **Easter Egg**: Script that prints “The Zen of Python” by Tim Peters.

## More Info
### Pycodestyle
Pycodestyle is the new standard for Python code styling. Although initially using PEP8, this project will gradually adopt Pycodestyle for cleaner, more maintainable code.
