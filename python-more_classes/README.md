# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project, guided by Guillaume and part of the Holberton School curriculum, focuses on deepening the understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, particularly around more complex uses of classes and objects.

## Level
- Master

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain and understand:

- **Why Python programming is awesome**: Appreciating the simplicity and power of Python for OOP.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understanding the fundamental concepts behind OOP.
- **Classes vs Objects/Instances**: Differentiating between classes, objects, and instances in Python.
- **Attributes and Methods**: How to define and utilize public, protected, and private attributes, and methods.
- **The `__init__` Method**: Usage and importance of the special constructor method in class definitions.
- **Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding**: Implementing OOP principles in Python.
- **Properties**: Using properties to manage attribute access and implement getters and setters the Pythonic way.
- **`__str__` and `__repr__` Methods**: Customizing object string representations for debugging and logging.
- **Class vs Instance Attributes**: Understanding the distinction and appropriate usage scenarios.
- **Class and Static Methods**: Differentiating between class methods, static methods, and instance methods.
- **Dynamic Attribute Creation**: How to dynamically add attributes to instances and classes.
- **The `__dict__` Attribute**: Exploring the dictionary attribute for class and instance objects.
- **Using `getattr`**: Safely accessing attributes using the built-in function.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **Styling**: Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 2.7.*).
- **Execution**: All your files should be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Documentation**: Each module, class, and method must contain docstring comments where appropriate.

## Tasks Overview
1. **0-rectangle.py**: An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
2. **1-rectangle.py**: A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by its width and height.
3. **2-rectangle.py**: Expanding the Rectangle class to include area and perimeter methods.
4. **3-rectangle.py**: Enhancing the Rectangle class to enable print() and str() to print the rectangle using the `#` symbol.
5. **4-rectangle.py**: Implementing the `__repr__` method to allow for the recreation of a new instance by using `eval()`.
6. **5-rectangle.py**: Customizing instance deletion with a special message upon deletion of a Rectangle instance.
7. **6-rectangle.py**: Introducing a class attribute to keep track of the number of Rectangle instances.
8. **7-rectangle.py**: Allowing for dynamic modification of the symbol used for string representation.
9. **8-rectangle.py**: Adding a static method to compare the area of two rectangles and return the biggest.
10. **9-rectangle.py**: Introducing a class method to create a square, showcasing that a square is a type of rectangle.
