# Python - Import & Modules

This project, part of the Holberton School curriculum and authored by Guillaume, focuses on the concepts of importing functions from other files, creating modules, and using command line arguments in Python. It's an introductory exploration into how Python handles modular programming.

## Level
Novice

## Weight
1

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to explain, without assistance:
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- How to import functions from another file.
- Usage of imported functions.
- Creation of a module.
- Utilization of the built-in function `dir()`.
- Preventing code in a script from being executed when imported.
- Using command line arguments in Python programs.

## Resources
- [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- [Command Line Arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments)
- [Pycodestyle â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
  - Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
  - Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*).
  - Files ending with a new line.
  - First line of all files: #!/usr/bin/python3.
  - README.md file at the root of the project folder.
  - Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*).
  - All files must be executable.
  - File lengths tested using wc.

## Tasks
1. **Import a simple function from a simple file**: Program that imports a function and prints the result of an addition.
2. **My first toolbox!**: Script that imports functions from a file and prints the results of some arithmetic operations.
3. **How to make a script dynamic!**: Program that prints the number of and list of its arguments.
4. **Infinite addition**: Script that adds all arguments and prints the result.
5. **Who are you?**: Program that prints names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
6. **Everything can be imported**: Script that imports a variable from a file and prints its value.
